# Day 3: Control Flow - If/Else & Loops

**Date**: November 24, 2025  
**Time Spent**: 3.5 hours  
**Status**: Complete ✅

## 🎯 What I Learned Today

### Control Flow Structures

**1. If-Else Statements**
- Simple if: Execute code conditionally
- If-else: Choose between two paths
- If-else-if: Multiple conditions
- Nested if: Conditions within conditions

**2. Loops - Three Types**

**For Loop**: Known iteration count
```c
for (init; condition; increment) {
    // repeated code
}
```
**While Loop**: Condition-based repetition

```c
while (condition) {
    // repeated code
}
```
**Do-While Loop**: Execute at least once

```c
do {
    // repeated code
} while (condition);
```
3. Loop Control

- break: Exit loop immediately

- continue: Skip to next iteration

4. Switch-Case Statement

- Multiple condition checking

- Cleaner than long if-else chains

🔑 Key Insights
When to Use Each Loop
For Loop:

Know exact iterations (1 to 10, 0 to n)

Array traversal (coming soon)

Pattern generation

While Loop:

Condition-based (continue until condition false)

User input validation

Game loops

Do-While Loop:

Menu systems (show menu at least once)

Input validation (ask at least once)

Loop Control Best Practices
Always ensure loop can terminate

Avoid infinite loops (unless intentional)

Update loop variable in body

Use break sparingly

Only for early exit conditions

Don't overuse (makes code hard to read)

Continue for skip logic

Skip certain iterations

Cleaner than nested if-else

🎮 Favorite Programs
