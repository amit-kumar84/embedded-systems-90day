# Day 3: Control Flow - If/Else & Loops

**Date**: November 24, 2025  
**Time Spent**: 3.5 hours  
**Status**: Complete ✅

## 🎯 What I Learned Today

### Control Flow Structures

**1. If-Else Statements**
- Simple if: Execute code conditionally
- If-else: Choose between two paths
- If-else-if: Multiple conditions
- Nested if: Conditions within conditions

**2. Loops - Three Types**

**For Loop**: Known iteration count
```c
for (init; condition; increment) {
    // repeated code
}
**While Loop**: Condition-based repetition
while (condition) {
    // repeated code
}
 **Do-While Loop: Execute at least once**
do {
    // repeated code
} while (condition);

**3. Loop Control**

break: Exit loop immediately

continue: Skip to next iteration

**4. Switch-Case Statement**

Multiple condition checking

Cleaner than long if-else chains
