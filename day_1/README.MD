## 📚 What I Learned

### GitHub & Version Control
- GitHub is portfolio for developers
- Every commit = documented progress
- Recruiters check GitHub activity
- Daily commits = better visibility

### Development Environment
- VS Code = industry-standard editor
- GCC compiler = converts C to executable
- Command line compilation: `gcc filename.c -o output`
- Running programs: `./output`

### First C Program
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
